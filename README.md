👋 Hello there, I'm @pmoret24! As a full-stack developer with a specialization in data science, I am passionate about using my technical skills to solve complex problems and create user-centric applications.

💻 My development toolbox includes R, Python, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Whether it's back-end processing or front-end interaction, I'm well-equipped to handle every part of the development cycle.

🔐 I'm proficient in managing SQL databases, a skill that compliments my data science aspirations and supports efficient data handling in application development.

🎓 I've honed my skills through the rigorous LeWagon Bootcamp, where I dove deep into a range of technologies and best practices in full-stack development.

🕵️‍♂️ Data is the new oil, and as a data science student at the University of British Colombia, I’m passionate about extracting, refining, and analyzing this valuable resource to make informed decisions and predictions.
